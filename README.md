# snyk-api-import
Snyk API project importer. This script is intended to help import projects into Snyk with a controlled pace utilizing available [Snyk APIs](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/).

What does it offer?
- `rate limiting handling` - the script will pace requests to avoid rate limiting from Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket etc and to provide a stable import.
- `queue` - requests to Snyk are queued to reduce failures.
- `retries` - the script will kick off an import in batches, wait for completion and then keep going. Any failed requests will be retried before they are considered a failure and logged.

If you need to adjust concurrency you can stop the script, change the concurrency variable and start again. It will skip previous repos/targets that have been requested for import.

# FAQ
<details>
<summary>What is the minimum version of Node that the tool supports?</summary>
<br/>
  <p>Please check the <code>.nvmrc</code> file for the supported version of Node.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><code>Error: ENFILE: file table overflow, open</code> or <code>Error: EMFILE, too many open files</code></summary>
<br/>
  <p>If you see these errors then you may need to bump <b>ulimit</b> to allow more open file operations. In order to keep the operations more performant tool logs as soon as it is convenient rather than wait until very end of a loop and log a huge data structure. This means depending on number of concurrent imports set the tool may exceed the system default <b>ulimit</b>.</p>
  <p>Some of these resources may help you bump the <b>ulimit</b>:</p>

<summary><code>ERROR: HttpError: request to https://github.private.com failed, reason: self signed certificate in certificate chain</code></summary>
<br/>
  <p>If your Github / Gitlab / Bitbucket / Azure is using a self signed certificate, you can configure snyk-api-import to use this certificate when calling the HTTPS APIs.</p>
  <code>export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=./path-to-ca</code>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Does this work with brokered integrations?</summary>
<br/>
  <p>
    Yes. because we reuse the existing integration with your SCM (git) repository to perform the imports, the brokered connection will be used when configured.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is supported for import command?</summary>
<br/>
  <p>
    snyk-api-import supports 100% of the same integration types and project sources as the <a href="https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/import-projects/import/import-targets">Import API documentation</a>. If an example is not in the docs for your use case please see the API documentation
